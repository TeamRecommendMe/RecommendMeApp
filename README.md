# Group Milestone 4 - *Recommend Me*

**Recommend me** is an app that recommends restaurants and activities to you. Weâ€™ve been there before just after we just got done doing something with friends or family. Like watching a movie or eating at a restaurant. We then try to decide what the group should do next.
